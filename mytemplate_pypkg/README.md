A template python package for building in dedicated python functionality as well
as combining subA and subB tools, which we are assume share some important
commonality, via symlinks.  A simpler but concrete example of this package is
[ibcdfo_pypkg](https://github.com/POptUS/IBCDFO/tree/main/ibcdfo_pypkg).

**TODO**: This should contain the information that we want to present to users
on PyPI and point to the package's online documentation.
