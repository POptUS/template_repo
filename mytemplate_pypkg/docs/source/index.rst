mytemplate python package
=========================

.. _ibcdfo_pypkg: https://github.com/POptUS/IBCDFO/tree/main/ibcdfo_pypkg

This package is a template python package for building in dedicated python
functionality as well as combining ``subA`` and ``subB`` tools, which we assume
share some important commonality, |via| symlinks.  A simpler but concrete
example of this package is the |poptus| python package `ibcdfo_pypkg`_.

Let's cite something random (:cite:t:`Golub13`) just so that we have a
non-empty bibliography with at least one cross-reference.
